Issue Summary

Duration: The outage lasted from 14:00 to 16:30 on June 3, 2024.

Impact: The primary user interface for our Airbnb clone application was down, affecting approximately 70% of our user base. Users experienced slow loading times and frequent 500 Internal Server Error messages, preventing them from booking or managing listings.

Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused an overwhelming amount of traffic to be directed to a single server, leading to its overload and subsequent failure.

Timeline

14:00
  The issue was detected by an automated monitoring system, which alerted the on-call engineer to a spike in error rates.
 14:05
 The on-call engineer confirmed the issue and began the initial investigation into server logs and metrics.
 14:15 
  An assumption was made that a recent deployment could be the cause; deployment logs and recent changes were reviewed.
  14:30
   Further investigation into database performers is needed once due to high query times noted in monitoring tools.
 15:00
   Escalated to senior engineers and infrastructure team after no apparent issues were found in the recent deployment or database.
 15:15 
   The infrastructure team identified that one server was receiving disproportionately high traffic.
 15:30
   Misconfiguration in load balancer settings was identified as the root cause.
 15:45 
   Load balancer settings were corrected and traffic was evenly distributed across all servers.
 16:00 
   Monitored the system to ensure stability; error rates began to drop.
 16:30 
   Full service was restored and confirmed stable.




Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. During a recent maintenance operation, the load balancer was incorrectly configured to direct the majority of incoming traffic to a single server instead of distributing it evenly across multiple servers. This server became overloaded, leading to high response times and frequent crashes.


To resolve the issue, the configuration of the load balancer was reviewed and corrected to ensure that traffic was properly distributed across all available servers. This involved updating the load balancer rules and restarting the load balancer service to apply the changes.



Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements Needed
 Implement more robust load balancer configuration management to prevent misconfigurations.
 Enhance monitoring to include checks for traffic distribution anomalies.
 Conduct regular load balancer configuration audits.

Tasks
1. Patch Load Balancer Configuration: Review and update current load balancer configuration rules to ensure proper traffic distribution.
2. Enhance Monitoring: Add specific alerts for uneven traffic distribution across servers.
3. Documentation: Update maintenance and deployment procedures to include verification steps for load balancer settings.
4. Training: Conduct training sessions on load balancer configuration and management for engineers.
5. Regular Audits: Schedule and perform regular audits of load balancer configurations to ensure ongoing compliance with best practices.
6. Automated Backups: Implement automated backups of load balancer configurations to facilitate quick recovery in case of future misconfigurations.

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future, ensuring a more stable and reliable service for our users.
